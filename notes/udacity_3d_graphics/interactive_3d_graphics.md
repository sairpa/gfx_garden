# Interactive 3D Graphics
## By Eric Haines, Autodesk

Main focus on fundamentals and using the inferences to build 3d graphics based applications

# Interactive 3D Rendering

Render -> To create an image :D
3D -> Representing the image in a 3 Dimensional Space
Interactive -> Not static and able to control, influence or affect things in the world

Distinction here being able to render things dynamically and also with agency of the user or interactions enabled!

## WebGL

Web Graphics Library

Supported amongst all chrome and firefox versions :D

## Core Ideas:

- [Refresh rate, frames per second](#interactivity-and-fps)
- [Eye, pinhole cam, view frustum]()
- [light- physical and virtual]()
- [the graphics pipeline]()
- [the painter's algorithm, z-buffer]()


## Interactivity and FPS

- Action and response
- 6 FPS is the minimal perceptable motion thought it still looks super choppy
- ideal fps are 24fps(films), 30fps(handheld consoles), 60fps(pc games)
- fps -> frame rate
- hertz -> monitor spec for max possible frames to be shown at one second
- films use 24fps thought won't look choppy due to the extensive use of motion blur and other techniques
- plus they are not interactive, which helps on not being discernable on the 24 vs 30 v 60 fps
