Unity hub somehow works in arch linux 😅

LTS Editors are mostly the best ones but

Default SRP Pipeline enough for our usecases, only the looks and how things appear changes but as we learn more rendering stuff, the pipeline would make good differences

All unity projects are modular, everything could be packaged and shared, has a bit of core 3d packages under the “Packages”

They come as packages as we can enable and disable as we see fit in their usecase…

### Color Spaces:

Rendering usually done in linear color spaces

Unity still uses gamma color space by default

Need to change this to linear in the init so as to have a better experience
